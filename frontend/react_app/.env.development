REACT_APP_N8N_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678
# This URL assumes n8n is exposed on localhost:5678 from the host machine's perspective.
# When running frontend via `npm start`, this allows it to call the n8n Docker container.
# If the frontend is also Dockerized and served by Nginx (as per frontend/Dockerfile),
# Nginx would need to be configured to proxy requests to the n8n service (e.g., http://n8n:5678).
# For this .env.development, it's for local React development server.

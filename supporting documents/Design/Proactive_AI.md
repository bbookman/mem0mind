Proactive Memory Assistant: Implementation Plan

Overview
A proactive feature for the memory application's chatbot that analyzes existing memories, identifies important topics, and initiates conversations with users through reminders and memory enrichment.

Core Components
1. Memory Analysis System
Periodically scan all user memories to identify:
Upcoming events (appointments, deadlines, meetings)
Incomplete memories missing key details
Use importance scoring based on configurable topics (healthcare, appointments, deadlines)
Extract dates, times, locations, and people from memory text
2. Proactive Engagement Mechanisms
Event Reminders
Identify time-sensitive memories with upcoming dates
Generate natural-sounding reminders at configurable intervals (1, 3, 7 days before)
Include relevant details extracted from memories (location, time, people involved)
Memory Enrichment
Identify incomplete memories missing key information
Generate follow-up questions to fill information gaps
Track which memories have been enriched to avoid repetitive questions
Implement cooldown periods between follow-up questions
3. Scheduling System
Configure analysis frequency (daily, hourly, weekly)
Run proactive cycles at specified times
Implement thread-safe scheduling with minimal resource usage
4. Notification Delivery
Support multiple notification methods:
Console logging (default/simplest)
Email notifications
Extensible design for future methods (SMS, push notifications)
5. Response Processing
Record and process user responses to enrichment questions
Extract new facts from responses
Add these facts to the memory system with proper metadata
Mark memories as enriched to prevent duplicate follow-ups
Integration with Existing Codebase
Extend memory_manager.py with new methods for proactive analysis
Create a new ProactiveAssistant class that works with the existing MemoryManager
Add new prompt templates for reminders and enrichment questions
Implement configuration options in the existing config structure
Technical Considerations
Use LLM for natural language generation of reminders and questions
Implement robust date/time extraction and processing
Add proper logging and error handling
Design for minimal performance impact on the main application

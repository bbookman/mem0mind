# Memory Application MVP Architecture Summary

## Project Context
Building an MVP for a memory application based on the comprehensive development plan for UserCortex SDK integration and proactive AI features. The application includes:
- Memory management with provider switching (mem0/UserCortex)
- Proactive AI assistant for reminders and memory enrichment
- Chat interface for user interactions

## Technology Stack Decision

### Core Architecture
- **Backend/Middleware**: n8n for workflow automation and orchestration
- **Frontend**: React-based chat interface (separate from n8n)
- **Language**: JavaScript/Node.js (unified ecosystem)
- **Communication**: HTTP webhooks between frontend and n8n workflows

### Data Storage Architecture
```
Frontend ↔ n8n workflows ↔ Main Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
                        ↕
                   Vector Store (mem0 for MVP)
```

**Database Layer:**
- **Main Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured data, metadata, retention policies
- **Vector Store**: mem0 for MVP (handles embeddings + metadata automatically)
- **Data Flow**: n8n manages both stores simultaneously

## Key Capabilities

### n8n Strengths for This Project
- Backend workflow automation (memory analysis, scheduling)
- API integrations (mem0, future UserCortex integration)
- Data processing and transformation
- Webhook handling for chatbot interactions
- Automated scheduling for proactive features

### n8n Limitations
- No native UI components (requires separate frontend)
- Limited to basic forms via Form Trigger node

## MVP Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core MVP
1. **n8n workflows** for memory operations
2. **Simple React frontend** for chat interface
3. **mem0** for vector storage and memory management
4. **PostgreSQL** for structured data and metadata

### Phase 2: Enhancement Options
- Custom n8n nodes for memory-specific operations
- Migration to dedicated vector store (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Advanced frontend features

## Development Workflow

### External Development Integration
n8n supports several external development approaches:
- **JSON workflows**: Export/import workflows for version control
- **Custom nodes**: Build reusable TypeScript/JavaScript packages
- **Code nodes**: JavaScript logic within workflows
- **HTTP integration**: Call external services

### Data Requirements Support
- **Configurable data retention**: Scheduled n8n workflows + database TTL
- **Hybrid processing**: Real-time via webhooks, batch via scheduled workflows
- **Native format preservation**: JSON storage with lightweight tagging
- **Export/backup tools**: n8n-automated database exports and backups
- **Performance optimization**: Database design for calendar/daily views

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Set up n8n (local or cloud)
2. Choose database (PostgreSQL with pgvector or MongoDB)
3. Configure mem0 for memory operations
4. Build basic React chat interface
5. Create n8n workflows for core memory operations

## Architecture Benefits
- Unified JavaScript ecosystem reduces complexity
- AI code generation works well across entire stack
- Scalable foundation for future enhancements
- Clear separation of concerns between components



I recommend **PostgreSQL** for your MVP because:

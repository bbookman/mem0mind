## Technical Architecture

### Memory Provider Interface
The core of the integration will be a provider interface that abstracts all memory operations:

```
BaseMemoryProvider (Abstract Class)
├── add_fact()
├── search_memories()
├── get_all_memories()
├── reset_memories()
├── chat()
└── ... other memory operations
```

### Provider Factory
A factory pattern will instantiate the appropriate provider based on configuration:

```
MemoryProviderFactory
├── create_provider()
└── get_provider_config()
```

### Configuration Structure
The configuration will be extended to support provider selection:

```
{
  "memory_provider": {
    "type": "mem0|usercortex",
    "fallback": "mem0",
    "config": {
      ... provider-specific configuration
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each provider implementation independently
- Validate interface compliance
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test application with each provider
- Validate data consistency between providers
- Test provider switching mechanism

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark memory operations with both providers
- Test under various load conditions
- Validate response times meet requirements

### User Acceptance Testing
- Verify feature parity from user perspective
- Test migration process with real data
- Validate configuration options

# Example Configuration for Lifeboard MVP
# Rename this file to .env in the project root or in config_lifeboard/ and ensure it's loaded by your services (e.g., via docker-compose env_file)

# --- PostgreSQL Database (primarily for n8n's own use, and potentially Lifeboard app data if not using separate DB for app) ---
# These are often set directly in docker-compose for the postgres service itself.
# If n8n or other apps need to connect, they might use these or specific credentials.
POSTGRES_USER=lifeboard_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strongpassword
POSTGRES_DB=lifeboard_db
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres # Service name in docker-compose
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# --- Qdrant (for Mem0 Vector Store) ---
QDRANT_HOST=qdrant # Service name in docker-compose, or localhost if run on host
QDRANT_PORT=6333

# --- Ollama (for local LLM and Embeddings used by Mem0) ---
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434 # Service name in docker-compose, or http://localhost:11434 if run on host
OLLAMA_LLM_MODEL=llama3.1 # Default LLM model for summarization/chat
OLLAMA_EMBEDDER_MODEL=nomic-embed-text # Default embedding model

# --- n8n Specific Configuration ---
# Base URL for n8n if needed by external services (e.g., for webhook URLs if not relative)
# N8N_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678
# Webhook URLs - These are paths appended to n8n base URL.
# The workflow files use these as defaults if specific $env vars aren't set.
# For more dynamic control, you can set these env vars.
# MOOD_WEBHOOK_PATH=webhook-mood
# DAILY_VIEW_WEBHOOK_PATH=webhook-daily-view
# CHAT_WEBHOOK_PATH=webhook-chat
# DAILY_SUMMARY_WEBHOOK_PATH=webhook-daily-summary

# --- Data Source API Keys & Config (for n8n workflows) ---
# These should ideally be stored as n8n credentials, but can be passed via env for simplicity in some setups.
# If using n8n credentials, these specific env vars might not be directly used by the workflow's HTTP Request node,
# but are listed here as a reminder of what needs to be configured.

# Limitless API (Example - use n8n credentials for actual storage)
# LIMITLESS_API_KEY=your_limitless_api_key
# LIMITLESS_API_URL=https://api.limitless.ai/v1/events

# Bee.computer API (Example - use n8n credentials)
# BEE_API_KEY=your_bee_api_key
# BEE_API_URL=https://api.bee.computer/v1/activities

# Weather API Configuration (User's location for Open-Meteo)
USER_LATITUDE=52.52
USER_LONGITUDE=13.41

# --- User Identification (for MVP single-user focus) ---
# This might be used by mem0_handler.py or workflows if not passed in requests
DEFAULT_USER_ID=lifeboard_user

# --- Frontend Configuration (REACT_APP_ variables are baked in at build time) ---
# Example: If frontend needs to know an API base URL not proxied
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678/api
# (Note: n8n webhooks are typically called directly, possibly via a proxy)

# --- Mem0 Handler specific (if not overridden by direct QDRANT/OLLAMA vars) ---
# MEM0_HISTORY_DB_PATH=/app/mem0_history.db # Example path if persisted outside Docker volume

# Note on API Keys:
# For production or shared environments, never commit actual API keys to version control.
# Use environment variables set in the deployment environment, Docker secrets, or a proper secrets manager.
# n8n has its own credential management system which is the preferred way for API keys used in its workflows.
# This .env file is primarily for service URLs and non-sensitive configurations for local development.

# Lifeboard

Powered by the **Digital Memoir Engine** (DME), is an interactive reflection space and powerful planning assistant where there is infinite opportunity for discovery and planning. Seamlessly pulling from your digital history—concerts attended, music loved, thoughts shared, places visited, meetings attended —it transforms each day into a personal newspaper. With an AI you can customize —factual, poetic, analytical, or playful—you’ll rediscover meaning in the everyday and take control of your future journey.
  
But you don’t always have to know where to look. Lifeboard invites serendipity through random resurfacing of forgotten moments and AI-guided discovery journeys—because some of life’s richest memories are the ones you didn’t expect to find.  

Beyond reflection, Lifeboard empowers the present and the future.  Your personal assistant will help you keep up with to-dos, pull out insights from business meetings, keep track of important medical appointments, and beyond
  
It’s about seeing anew—with clarity, gratitude, proactive power and wonder.

Lifeboard is open source out of the gate and made to run on your computer and not the cloud.
